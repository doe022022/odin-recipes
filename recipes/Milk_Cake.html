      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This is a super moist and tasty coconut cake. Growing up in Brazil, this was a favorite amongst our circle of friends. It is especially good with a cup of coffee on the side. I've converted a few of my anti-coconut family and friends into lovers of this cake.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>  1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Step1:</strong> <br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
          <li><strong>Step2:</strong> <br>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
          <li><strong>Step3:</strong> <br>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.</li>
          <li><strong>Step4:</strong> <br> Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.

         </li>
          <li><strong>Step5:</strong>: <br>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
