      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ stick butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>3 medium lemons, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Step1:</strong> <br>Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces. 
            Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thin.
             Place flour on a plate and dredge each breast on both sides in flour.

          </li>
          <li><strong>Step2:</strong> <br> Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
             Put chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and pepper.
              Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and season again.
               Cook second side until browned, about 4 minutes. 
            Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.</li>
          <li><strong>Step3:</strong> <br>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, about 5 minutes more. 
            Add capers and pour sauce over chicken breasts on the plate. 
            Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
          <li><strong>Step4:</strong> <br> To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
         </li>
          <li><strong>Step5:</strong>: <br>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
